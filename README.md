# ZType Clone Game in React

Welcome to the ZType Clone Game, a typing challenge that tests your speed and accuracy. Enemies approach from all directions, and your job is to type them away before they reach the center!

## Features

- **Dynamic Enemies**: Enemies appear from all around the screen. Each enemy represents a word. Type the word to destroy the enemy.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The longer you survive, the more frequent and challenging the enemies become.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your typing prowess with a score that increases for each enemy defeated.
